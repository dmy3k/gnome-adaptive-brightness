# Adaptive brightness

GNOME Shell extension that automatically adjusts your screen brightness based on ambient light conditions, helping to reduce eye strain and save energy. It also includes an optional keyboard backlight service that runs automatically based on ambient light.

**Note: This extension requires GNOME Shell 49 or newer.** It uses the new BrightnessManager API introduced in GNOME 49 for improved brightness control.

# Background

GNOME includes "Automatic Screen Brightness" feature, under Settings -> Power -> Power Saving.
It has a number of issues reported that make it challenging to use in some scenarios (e.g [#277](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/issues/277), [#82](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/issues/82), [#237](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/merge_requests/237)).

This extension addresses some of the issues with custom implementation:

- **Improved Algorithm**: More stable under often changing light conditions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gradually changes brightness to avoid jarring jumps
- **Respects System States**: Better coexistence with brightness set by user and system states (display dim/off)
- **Gamma Correction**: Uses perceptually uniform brightness adjustments (Î³=2.2) that match human vision and display hardware
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns your brightness preferences and applies them across all light levels
