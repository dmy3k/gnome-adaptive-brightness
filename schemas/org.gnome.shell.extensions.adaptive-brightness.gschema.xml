      <summary>Brightness curve buckets</summary>
      <description>
        Array of brightness buckets defining how screen brightness responds to ambient light.
        Each tuple contains: (minimum_lux, maximum_lux, brightness_level).
        Brightness level is 0.0-1.0 (0-100%).
        Ranges can overlap to provide hysteresis effect.

      <summary>Keyboard backlight levels per bucket</summary>
      <description>
        Array of keyboard backlight levels for each brightness bucket.
        Each value is the backlight brightness level (0 to hardware max) to apply when in that bucket.
        0 means backlight is off for that bucket.
        The array length must match the number of brightness buckets.
        Default: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0] means full brightness in darkest bucket, low in second bucket, off for others.

      <summary>Keyboard backlight idle timeout</summary>
      <description>
        Time in seconds of user inactivity before the keyboard backlight is turned off
        to save power. The backlight will automatically turn back on when user activity
        is detected in low light conditions.
